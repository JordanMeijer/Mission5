# Mission5

This was a project where I worked along side UX designers to renovate Turners Car Insurance Process.
We collaborated in an agile enviroment where we did daily standups. 
Feedback was provided on what I thought was feesible to code and what I also thought would help make the website accesible.

Here is the figma design I was working from
